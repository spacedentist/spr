A command-line tool for submitting and updating GitHub Pull Requests from local
Git commits that may be amended and rebased. Pull Requests can be stacked to
allow for a series of code reviews of interdependent code.

spr is pronounced /ˈsuːpəɹ/, like the English word 'super'.

## Installation

### Binary Installation

#### Using Homebrew

```shell
brew install spr
```

#### Using Nix

spr is available in nixpkgs

```shell
nix run nixpkgs#spr
```

#### Using Cargo

If you have Cargo installed (the Rust build tool), you can install spr by running

```shell
cargo install spr
```

### Install from Source

spr is written in Rust. You need a Rust toolchain to build from source. See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for information on how to install Rust if you have not got a Rust toolchain on your system already.

With Rust all set up, clone this repository and run `cargo build --release`. The spr binary will be in the `target/release` directory.

## Quickstart

To use spr, run `spr init` inside a local checkout of a GitHub-backed git repository. You will be asked for a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token), which spr will use to make calls to the GitHub API in order to create and merge pull requests.

To submit a commit for pull request, run `spr diff`.

If you want to make changes to the pull request, amend your local commit (and/or rebase it) and call `spr diff` again. When updating an existing pull request, spr will ask you for a short message to describe the update.

To squash-merge an open pull request, run `spr land`.

For more information on spr commands and options, run `spr help`. For more information on a specific spr command, run `spr help <COMMAND>` (e.g. `spr help diff`).
